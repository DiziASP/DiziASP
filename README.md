# ðŸ‘‹ Kenalin, Raden Dizi Assyafadi Putra, Leo, 20 Tahun! ðŸ¤š

I am currently a second-year Undergraduate Student at ITB who has a big interest in Web Development, iOS/Android Development, and Machine Learning. 
During my first year, I managed to create a Mention Confess (Menfess) website using ReactJS and Python (Flask). This website was used for my group's Final Project. I also learn about Data Science using Python's Pandas.
For my second year, I'm planning to focus on participating in competition, learning advance skills related to programming, and finding internships or part-time jobs, all while completing my studies.
